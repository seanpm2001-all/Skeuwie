Translations in languages other than English are machine translated and are not yet accurate. No errors have been fixed yet as of April 26th 2021. Please report translation errors [here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Skeuwie_Desktop_Environment/issues/) make sure to backup your correction with sources and guide me, as I don't know languages other than English well (I plan on getting a translator eventually) please cite [wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org) and other sources in your report. Failing to do so will result in a rejection of the correction being published.

Note: due to limitations with GitHub's interpretation of markdown (and pretty much every other web-based interpretation of markdown) clicking these links will redirect you to a separate file on a separate page that isn't my GitHub profile page. You will be redirected to the [seanpm2001/seanpm2001 repository](https://github.com/seanpm2001/seanpm2001), where the README is hosted.

Translations are done with Google Translate due to limited or no support for the languages I need in other translation services like DeepL and Bing Translate. I am working on finding an alternative. For some reason, the formatting (links, dividers, bolding, italics, etc.) is messed up in various translations. It is tedious to fix, and I do not know how to fix these issues in languages with non-latin characters, and right to left languages (like Arabic) extra help is needed in fixing these issues

Due to maintenance issues, many translations are out of date and are using an outdated version of this `README` article file. A translator is needed. Also, as of April 26th 2021, it is going to take me a while to get all the new links working.

## What is Skeuwie

Skeuwie is a UNIX-like desktop environment for Linux and other *NIXs that promotes Skeuomorphism above all else. Don't worry, memory management is still a key priority.

The entire environment is meant to display high levels of Skeuomorphism, such as that of the early Mac OS X (up to OS X 10.9.3) and the early iPhoneOS and iOS (up to iOS 6.3) most notably the Aqua user interface. It won't be a MacOS or iOS reskin, although skinning options will be available (up to iOS 6 and OS X 10.9)

Skeuwie is the default environment for:

[WacOS, GitHub link](https://github.com/seanpm2001/WacOS) - Uses the Wac theme by default

[No other environments at the moment](https://www.example.com)

The name of this project has been simplified to Ske**u**wie, instead of Ske**uo**wie, due to a spelling error. I will keep it like this, as it is a hard word to spell.

***

## What is Skeuomorphism

Brief overview from Wikipedia:

[Skeuomorph - From English Wikipedia, the Free Encyclopedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeuomorph)

A skeuomorph (/ˈskjuːəˌmɔːrf, ˈskjuːoʊ-/) is a derivative object that retains ornamental design cues (attributes) from structures that were inherent to the original. Examples include pottery embellished with imitation rivets reminiscent of similar pots made of metal and a software calendar that imitates the appearance of binding on a paper desk calendar.

Some common examples:

![Wikimedia example](/Images/Wikimedia/Rainlendar_Skins.jpg)

![iOS 6 example](/Images/Wikimedia/iOS_6/IOS_6_Home_Screen.png)

![Mac OS X Panther (10.3)](/Images/Wikimedia/Mac_OS_X_Panther/AM_MacOSX_Panther.png)

***

## Themes

Skeuwie has several Skeuomorphic themes, such as:

* Aurorath - An Aurora Borealis theme

* Polished steel - A polished metal theme

* Space - A space theme <!-- with Wookies, Skeuwies !-->

* Wac - Imitates MacOS and iOS

***

## Extensions

Skeuwie has some optional extensions with it:

* BlueCalm theme [GitHub link](https://github.com/seanpm2001/BlueCalm_Theme/)

* LinkLax [GitHub link](https://github.com/seanpm2001/LinkLax/)

* Compiz

***

## Programs

Here are some of the optional default programs that come with Skeuwie:

* VLC Media Player (skinless by default)

* LibreOffice (with a Skeuomorphism theme)

* Okular (with a Skeuomorphism theme)

* KClock (modified to add more Skeuomorphism)

* VirtualBox

* Cam Cam + [GitHub link](https://github.com/seanpm2001/CamCamPlus/)

* Konsole (with a Skeuomorphism theme)

* Konquerer (web browser and file viewer) modified to add more Skeuomorphism

## Version history

**Version history currently unavailable**

**No other versions listed**

## Software status

All of my works are free some restrictions. DRM (**D**igital **R**estrictions **M**anagement) is not present in any of my works.

![DRM-free_label.en.svg](DRM-free_label.en.svg)

This sticker is supported by the Free Software Foundation. I never intend to include DRM in my works.

I am ussing the abbreviation "Digital Restrictions Management" instead of the more known "Digital Rights Management" as the common way of addressing it is false, there are no rights with DRM. The spelling "Digital Restrictions Management" is more accurate, and is supported by [Richard M. Stallman (RMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman) and the [Free Software Foundation (FSF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation)

This section is used to raise awareness for the problems with DRM, and also to protest it. DRM is defective by design and is a major threat to all computer users and software freedom.
